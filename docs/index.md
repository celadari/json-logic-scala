[Get started now](#what-is-json-logic){: .btn .btn-primary .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 .mr-2 } [View it on GitHub](https://github.com/celadari/json-logic-scala){: .btn .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 }

This library includes:
* a type-annotated implementation of [JsonLogic](https://jsonlogic.com),
letting you represent expressions and types (language agnostic!)
* methods to serialize Scala data structures as Typed JsonLogic
* methods to deserialize Typed JsonLogic into Scala data structures
* easily customizeable methods to evaluate these expressions in Scala
